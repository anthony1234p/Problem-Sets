This code contains two functions, encrypt and decrypt, which work together to encrypt and decrypt a message using the DNA Factory. 
The encrypt function takes a message as input and maps each character to a corresponding DNA line. 
The decrypt function takes the encrypted message as input and maps each DNA line back to its corresponding character to reveal the original message.
Madeline and Rafa helped me with a bug fix with a mispelt variable.
